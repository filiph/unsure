# Unsure Calculator

[![Build Status - Cirrus][]][Build status]

If you want to run the Unsure Calculator from source, this repository
is for you. Otherwise, please go to 
[filiph.github.io/unsure][webapp] to learn more
about the Unsure Calculator itself, and run it—for free—from your browser.


## Web app

The web calculator is in `example/`. To run it from source (assuming you have
the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed):

    $ cd example/
    $ pub get
    $ webdev serve --release

Now, navigating to `http://localhost:8080` will open the page. Changing
code in the project will trigger a rebuild. The `--release` flag is important,
because otherwise the web worker won't work.

To publish the example to 
[filiph.github.io/unsure](https://filiph.github.io/unsure), do the following:

1. Install peanut (only once): `pub global activate peanut`
2. Go to the example directory: `cd example`
3. Run peanut: `peanut`
4. Push the newly updated `gh-pages` branch to github: 
   `git push origin --set-upstream gh-pages`


## Command line tool

You can run the command line version of the calculator by executing something
like `dart bin/unsure.dart "10 * 2~3"` from the root of the repository. 
To get help, run `dart bin/unsure.dart --help`.

You can compile the tool to a binary executable by running 
`dart2native bin/unsure.dart -o unsure`. Then, call the binary like this:

    $ ./unsure "10~20 * 42"

![An animated gif of the binary in action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/919717/77241570-1a216100-6bb1-11ea-8e9d-e10b1aaf2106.gif)

This compiled binary starts much faster than if you run the code through 
`dart bin/unsure.dart "..."`.

Note that the command line tool defaults to 1 million iterations (compared
to the 250K iterations of the web tool). That makes it a bit more precise
(meaning that the results will be a tiny bit closer to the truth, and 
the histogram will be smoother). We can do this because Dart (compiled or not)
runs a lot faster than JavaScript. That said, in my experiments, 250K iterations
is precise enough.

### Easy installation

If you don't want to clone the repository and just want to try the command line
tool, you can use `pub` (part of the Dart SDK) to install it:

    $ pub global activate unsure

Or, if you have the Flutter SDK installed:

    $ flutter pub global activate unsure

You might need to follow instructions that `pub` gives you, but after that,
you can just run `unsure` as a regular command line program from anywhere.

Run it with `nix`:
```shell
nix run github:/filiph/unsure
```

Or when in the directory:
```shell
nix run .#unsure
```

## Package

Apart from that online tool, this is also a (beginning of a) package. 
Read through `bin/unsure.dart` to see how it might be used.

Here's a more low-level example of use:

```dart
import 'package:unsure/unsure.dart';

void main() {
    var principal = 1000;
    var interestRate = Range(2, 4);
    var time = Range(10, 12);
    
    var calc = Calculation(
      () => principal * (1 + interestRate.next() / 100) * time.next());
    
    var result = calc.run();
    
    print(result.simple);
    print(result.histogram);
    print(result.confidences[99]);
}
```

In this example, we defined one constant (`principal`), two ranges
(`interestRate` and `time`), and a custom callback that computes compound
interest given the above. The callback can be arbitrary Dart code: you are
not limited to the format understandable by `lib/src/parser.dart`.


## Help needed

There's only so much I (Filip) can do myself. If this is ever going to be
a truly open source project, I need to remove myself from a lot of the
ownership of this thing. 

* Can you help me publish the CLI binary to popular repositories such as
  APT, Homebrew, or Nugget? I know how to compile the tool on each platform,
  but I don't know what to do next.
* Can you come up with more interesting use case or formula, and write 
  an article about it? The companion article at 
  [filiph.github.io/unsure][webapp] is already too long.
* Similarly, can you record a video tutorial explaining the use of this tool?
* Can you help me automate the creation of binaries for each release, for each
  platform? I hear GitHub actions is the way to do it, but I've never done it.
* If you're familiar with `package:petitparser`, can you help me rewrite the
  formula parser so it's more helpful? In particular, I'd like it to give
  more helpful feedback to the user.
* Can you help me automate test coverage reporting?
* Can you help me make the command line executable more stable?
* Can you help me make the [Unsure Calculator site][webapp] into 
  a true Progressive Web App?
* Can you help me put the range (`~`) notation into more calculators out there?

If you're interested in helping, please see if there's
[an issue](https://github.com/filiph/unsure/issues) you might assign to
yourself, and if not, create it.


## Language

I've done some research on what people generally mean when they say things like
"certainly" in regular speech. This might be useful when talking about
probabilities with untrained statisticians (such as myself).

| Noun | Adverb | Percentage | Sigma |
| -----| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| All | Certainly | 100 % | - |
| Almost all | Almost certainly | 95 % | 2 |
| Large majority | Quite possibly | 68 % | 1 |
| Bare majority | Possibly | 50+ % | - |
